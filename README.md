A machine learning to find lego bricks
Topic: Miscellaneous 


**Implementing Our Project**
For the project, we unfortunately do not have the time to train a machine learning model capable of identifying all LEGO parts out there. Therefore, We have decided that we will create a scalable AI model that could identify at least one lego part as a proof of concept. This project was really difficult for us because generating synthetic data and object detection with deep learning are areas where we have not had any experience with.


**Our Data**

LEGO PART 32498 Technic Gear 36 Tooth Double Bevel


**Dataset**
With the blender application, we wrote a script to generate data with a 3D model of a gear.
